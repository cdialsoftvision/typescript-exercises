Intro:

    All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go
    forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.
    Let's add a couple of admins.

    Initially we only had users in the in-memory database. After
    introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that
    everything works well together.

Exercise:

    Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use
    it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix
    all the TS errors.
